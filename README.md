# n-gon-solution-viewer

"Of all n-gons lying in the cartesian plane, all of whose vertices are lattice points, and whose sides are of length 1,2,3,…,n in some order, which two have the largest and smallest area?"

This question was proposed by Bernardo Recamán Santos in two posts to Puzzling Stack Exchange

 - https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/99365/largest-and-smallest-dodecagon-with-sides-1-2-3-dots-12
 - https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/99415/largest-and-smallest-hexadecagon-with-sides-1-2-3-dots-16

Solutions are proven to exist for all n >= 7, where 4 | n or 4 | n + 1

This repository contains a simple viewer for the best known results for small values of n.

Improvements for these n-gons would be very much welcome.
